webgl-marchingcubes
===================

A WebGL implementation of the marching cubes algorithm for deformable terrain

Prerequisites
=============

If you don't already have a static file serving solution, you'll need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). You won't need to install any other packages, though.

Running the App
===============

First, host the files. You can do this using Node.js and `fileserver.js`, located in the root directory.

    > node fileserver.js
    
This will host the directory on `http://localhost:8888`. Navigate there to view the scene.
